# contact me

## who am i?

I'm a reporter with the Wall Street Journal's Washington, DC bureau where I cover a variety of topics: national security, criminal justice, constitutional law, privacy, cybersecurity, intelligence and legal afairs.

## how to reach me

Email is the best for routine, unsensitive matters: **[byron.tau@wsj.com](mailto:byron.tau@wsj.com)**. I am on Twitter at **[@byrontau](https://www.twitter.com/byrontau)** and my DMs are open to all. I'm also on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/byrontau)**.

## secure communication

For greater security, the number **+1 202-441-1171** belongs to me and is linked to **iMessage,** **Signal**, **Confide** **WhatsApp** and **Wickr**. All of those services are end-to-end encrypted, but they differ in the metadata collected about the communications. Most experts agree that Signal is probably the most secure. Be warned that Whatsapp is owned by Facebook and collects significant metadata about conversation between users. 

I also have Protonmail account, which is zero-knowledge end-to-end encrypted *only with other Protonmail users*. **[byron.tau@protonmail.com](mailto:byron.tau@protonmail.com)**

A reminder that end-to-end encryption is only as good as the ends and is still vulnerable in some cases. You should also give thought to retention. Signal, ProtonMail and Confide all have self-destructing mesage options, though that is not foolproof.  All method of communication involves some risk. 

The WSJ also maintains a Secure Drop, a secure communication platform designed for journalists and sources. Instructions are available **[here](https://www.wsj.com/tips)**

Postal mail is als a great option — but keep in mind that the exterior of envelopes are scanned. I can be reached by postal mail at the address below:


Byron Tau</br>

Washington, D.C. 20036</br>

(One caveat: With the current COVID-19 emergency, I check my office mail very infrequently so expect significant delays in my ability to reply quickly. You may consider tipping me off electronically somehow that there is mail waiting for me.)
